I am also very experienced with Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader and other PDF programs, Quickbooks and Quicken, and others too numerous to list.WRITING/EDITING/PROOFREADINGI love to write and have performed a great deal of writing, editing, and proofreading during my career and personally. I have frequently created legal documents based on deposition transcripts, interviews with clients or witnesses, research, and other sources. I have also edited attorney communications to make them grammatically correct and to make them flow more smoothly.

Samples of editing and writing are available upon request.FILE CONVERSION AND DATA MANIPULATIONI am very skilled at taking hard copies of documents, both numbers and words, and converting them into data and documents to work with in Excel, Word, and Access, as well as taking documents from one software application and converting them to another software's format.

I have a USB foot pedal and headphones; standard size cassette transcriber; and microcassette size transcriber.BOOKKEEPING/ACCOUNTINGI am very proficient using both Quicken and Quickbooks. The last attorney I worked for in a traditional law firm setting was a sole practitioner. I did all of his payroll, bookkeeping, and accounting using Quickbooks, and prepared his quarterly payroll taxes. I use Quickbooks for my business accounting and Quicken for my personal accounting.MARKETING AND WEB DESIGNI was in charge of all of the advertising and marketing at the last law firm I worked at full time. I created the advertisements for the newspaper and phone books, created the website, and created the direct mail campaign. I also created a very extensive website for my freelance paralegal business. I also recently began a new website using Google's Adsense as well as other affiliate programs in order to generate income. ALL PROJECTSMy finished product will meet any specifications you set forth and will be very closely proofread.

ARDIZZONI______________________________________________________________________Human Resources;I have a Ph.D. in Biology with a major in Neuroscience(medical) and minors in Biochemistry, Physics, and Mathematics with experience in basic and clinical research as well as teaching at the college level.  Have developed expertise in writing grants, developing experimental protocols, publishing in scientific journals, presenting seminars, and supervising/training faculty/staff/students.  Physics has given me great insight to concepts of problem solving.  Able to keep up with new information and to handle tight deadlines, administrative duties, planning, and fiscal aspect.  When working with novel research from a single lab, one has to perform all aspects  of the business.  There is very little division of labor.  You must be completely self reliant as research is highly competitive.  Do your work well and publish first.  I am self motivated/directed and interested in making a career change into marketing/sales.  I feel this would make better use of my educational background and skills.  Teaching has gone as far as it can go.  At this point I need different challenges, environment, and greater salary. I am presenting for your review my skills, achievements, and talents to support my capability to apply myself  to the area of marketing/sales.  As a Ph.D. in biology with medical background, I am as knowledgeable as my clients would be.  Having worked with neurologists, neurobiologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists, I have the same background and understand the personalities involved and find it easy to communicate with this community.Results achieved to date includes:\xc2\xb7\tClinical Conference/diagnoses and prognoses on neurological patients \xe2\u20ac\u201c received excellent evaluations.\xc2\xb7\tBrain transplant research/behavioral testing completed successfully.

A University graduate, qualified bilingual secretary and English teacher, I have worked in commercial, banking, education and literary sectors, using both French and English. I have lived and worked in France since 1990.I know the importance of a precise translation. No matter what the function of the document, the translation must render the very same meaning and style as the original. If you need an administrative letter translated for your own purposes you need to know its importance and if any action is required of you. Similarly, the translation of a document aimed at potential customers must offer a good image of your company and be as persuasive as the original copy. You know how much you spend on translations. What you cannot be sure of is how much revenue you have missed out on because of non-existent or poor translations. Quality is essential to a high performing business, and I am committed to producing high quality work.Proofreading : Are you sending out the right message? People might not tell you so, but they do notice bad spelling and grammar and make judgments about you and your business as a result. Effective English which flows smoothly and remains in the same register can have a positive impact on the image your company projects to the public. Is your English good enough to persuade customers to choose your company over another?

Currently, I am trying to break in to this line of work, and will be grateful to those companies that assist me in starting my voyage on this new career path. I am the type of person who aims to assist my allies in their goals, helping to amplify their desired aim as much as possible. This means I aim to work thoroughly with any client, and communicate as frequently as necessary to get the project as perfect as possible.It is in any freelance designers best interest to do their best for their client- the more clout the client gets, the better the resume of the freelancer. With this in mind, thorough research goes into any project design, from many angles- be it polling the local populace on their color associations (here in Quakertown, red is associated with personal power, according to a street poll I conducted for fashion design research), psychological marketing research for shape preferences (according to ""Infants Preferences for Toys, Colors, and Shapes: Sex Differences and Similarities "", written by Vasanti Jadva, Melissa Hines, and Susan Golombok, both male and female infants show a preference for rounded over angular shapes, red toned objects over blue, and that later acquired gender association shifts the girls towards pink, and boys towards blue), or basic current trends of style in the given demographic's culture, this research helps custom tailor the finished product to the targeted niche. I have faith that I will be a very competent designer, and am comfortable tackling many projects- from product labels to children's books, fashion illustration to advertisements, I am willing to assist with the research myself, or work with already compiled notes. I am also a writer, more suited to freelance articles and blogging than to business proposals."

Before that I was a newspaper reporter for 11 years. Take a look at my company's website and you'll see some of the books we've done, including ""Internalizing the Vision"" by Sonny Arguinzoni of Victory Outreach in Los Angeles and ""The Life Story of Lester Sumrall"" for LeSea Broadcasting in South Bend, Indiana, and ""Blood In, Blood Out"" for Monarch Books in England.For the last 20 years, we have put out Christian Crusade Newspaper, which is in its 58th year of publication. How can we help you? The author of ""From Holocaust to Hallelujah"" brought that book to us thinking he'd told his complete story. He just wanted a simple edit. He described watching Nazi stormtroopers haul away his grandparents, then his family's escape to Berlin where his father chose to hide in plain sight for the duration of World War II. One paragraph described the author's arrival as a small boy at Berlin City Dump, where he played daily with other little refugees. The next paragraph told how glad he was to see Allied planes in 1944.But, wait! He'd just skipped most of World War II! My editing would have satisfied him, but the finished product was far better after I drew out of him details of what it was like to hide from Hitler Youth as a five-year-old, scavenge for food as a seven-year-old and crawl through bombed-out buildings in search of anything of value as a nine-year-old. I bring this storytelling skill and eye for detail to your project. You want somebody who will make your book so riveting and authoritative that the reader cannot put it down. Additionally, if you have the means to market your book yourself, I have ample experience in cover design and typesetting -- and years of dealing with high-quality, low-cost printers who can save you thousands of dollars."

My first language is French, having been born in Switzerland and attending primary schools in Belgium.  Upon immigrating to Canada, my parents chose to live in Montr\xc3\xa9al because, from afar, as a francophone community, that city seemed the most appropriate choice for our family.            Law school (McGill University) enabled me to expand my knowledge of French in my study of Civil Law, based on the Napoleonic Code of France.  In my legal studies, the French I spoke at home as my native tongue, together with college level French literature courses, served as the basis for my learning the language at a higher level.  I graduated from law school fluent in both French and English, and proficient in writing scholarly papers and examinations in both languages.       In my lucrative business career (import/export & real estate) after law school, I traveled extensively for many years and, even when not traveling, dealt continually with clients and suppliers coming from diverse cultures and speaking different languages.              Since the beginning of what is sometimes referred to as the 'new economy', I have replaced my previous business.

WHY GU TECH?Concentration on core business areas.Back office operations of a company require high maintenance and specialized attention. Yet most of them are critical for the company's everyday activities. By outsourcing their back office operations businesses can concentrate on their core competencies while their back office operations are being managed smoothly by a specialized third party company.World-class technology at lower rates.Investing in new technology is very costly and often risky. As the technology market develops rapidly, it is difficult to keep up with latest innovations and solutions. Thus outsourcing to companies that have the resources, expertise and desire to continuously update their technological solutions, offers a true advantage of outsourcing.Skilled manpower at affordable prices.Outsourcing gives a company the ability to get access to skilled and trained man power at extremely low rates. This in turn leads to an increase in productivity as well as cost savings. By outsourcing a company saves on recruitment, training and other human resource costs it would otherwise have to maintain internally. Also an advantage of outsourcing is that a company is able to utilize the kind of expertise it could not internally provide. Beat Competition.In today\xe2\u20ac\u2122s fast paced global economy a company needs to provide high-quality services to its customers in order to retain them, as well as provide the services for cheap prices. Outsourcing in this case can help the company maintain lower rates with better service solutions, thereby giving them a better market position or even a competitive advantage. Improve company focus.Outsourcing lets the company focus on broader business issues while having operational details assumed by an outside expert. For many companies, the single most compelling reason for outsourcing is that several of the 'how' type of issues are siphoning off huge amounts of management's time and attention. Too often, the resolution of these issues are stuck in middle management 'decision gridlock.' This creates financial and opportunity costs that affect the organization's future.Redirect resources toward activities with greater return.Most often, the resources redirected through outsourcing are people resources. By outsourcing non-core functions, the organization can redirect these people, or at least the staff slots they represent, onto greater value-adding activities. People whose energies are currently focused internally can now be focused externally -- on the customer. Improve productionIncreased productivity - more work get processed in less time outside the company facility thereby allowing corporate energy to focus on core functions.Scaleable.A cost effective solution that may begin moderately can grow exponentially without any increase in capital expense or human resources."

He started learning the web design and web development by starting to modify the aspect of each page after learning how from web tutorials.Summer 2006 was game changing for him as he found out that people were in need of online presence for their small businesses, coming to him to provide solutions for their small presentation websites through referrals. At first this was a challenge, because there was the switching from game design, which was childish, to business design who needed to have a more professional look.Beating up the presentation website challenge which consisted of static HTML pages, he got tasked in 2007 needing to build a shopping cart  many hours of learning and practice, he self-taught himself about PHP programming, MySQL databases and making all the pieces work together he won his second challenge.After winning the design, code, program challenges his possibilities were endless, he managed to get more clients, more projects, and more knowledge, expanding from a small city in a small country to worldwide."

THEY ARE NOT THE SAME !!!I apologize for making that point so strongly but so many customers are caught out by eye catching offers of a cheap price, not realizing that this is usually going to do far more harm to their site than good.SEO can't any longer be achieved for a few pounds with automated software. If you want SEO that works today and consistently drives top rankings for the key phrases that are most valuable to your business, then you need to use the unique White Hat SEO provided by me, which does absolutely everything needed to achieve Google page 1 rankings.Service DescriptionTrying to cut corners or save money by using cheap overseas back link builders, some spun content and a blog nobody reads is simply a false economy\xe2\u20ac\xa6 You will only either end up with lesser key phrases that will not drive the large quantities of high quality traffic to your site that you want\xe2\u20ac\xa6 Or you may target the right keywords but end up with Page 3 and lower rankings that are basically pointless in terms of SEO results and will have no benefit to your business whatsoever.

We give them what they want and they\xe2\u20ac\u2122re then happy to give us what we want in return.And No Client of ours has EVER been negatively affected by any Google upgrade !!!By employing our services you're going to get access to over 20 years of testing, failing, tripping, winning, trying... and everything else we've needed to refine our services to guarantee your success.And if you are unsure in any way about the true value of any investment, just take a look at the unedited and independent 5 Star client testimonials right here on Elance and on our company website in recognition of our services.I turn projects around on-time every-time, providing 10 years of proven success and the fact that we are ranked all time at #4 out of nearly 500,000 freelancers, should tell you everything you need to know about the value we bring to your business.I may not be the cheapest but trying to save a few pounds using completely ineffective SEO and pointless outdated methods, is simply a false economy that will only cost you thousands later in wasted potential and significantly reduced profits.So please don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t fall into the potentially fatal trap of comparing our services to cheaper companies and pointless overseas link builders that can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t actually deliver the Page 1 rankings you both want and need.Just get in touch and let us provide World Class SEO and Authority Building that will deliver the significant quantities of highly targeted traffic you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re looking for."

I have written several articles on various subject.  I am a copywriter as well.  I also write poems, articles, reports, and prose.  I am a fast typist and can type more than 60wpm and so I accept captcha work entry, PDF to Word file, and other Data Entry. I have conducted several training in Behavioral Development, Personality Development, Time Management, Leadership Training, English Proficiency, and the likes.  I have done academia-research work and found GAF as a better and wider source of freelance work.  For a sample of my writing prowess, here's one article already posted on the internet.Sample Article posted at Involvementby: Mary Rose Gob27 August 2007""To make them understand, get them involved."" For the long years in the practice of my profession, I have often encountered these questions from different organizations where I have conducted trainings: How will you let your members be involved with the organization's goals and aspirations? It seems that employees just come and go. I don't know how I will be able to get their commitment and loyalty to the company. What is the best approach to make people stay? These and other questions focus on the same concern--INVOLVEMENT. In one of the KAPI Professionals' meetings, Bro. Daniel Razon mentioned that one way to make members understand about KAPI is TO GET THEM INVOLVED. Vice versa, to make people participate in the organization, we should help them understand what is the purpose of KAPI's existence is. If you want people to stay long and be involved in the company or organization, we have to consider the following: (1) In the recruitment of new members, identify the vacancies, the culture of the group and the skills required for a certain position. To find the right person for the right job, the interest of the applicant must be considered. His skills and goals must be aligned with the direction of the company and his personality or character must be in consonance with the culture of the company. (2) In the case of an organization, people join groups where they find persons of same interests, aspirations and where they think can achieve their personal goals. In the KAPI for example, its vision and mission of KAPI entail that the organization must always be ready to assist in the financial needs of the Members Church of God International (MCGI) in propagating the Words of God. Thus, this vision-mission must be made clear to KAPI aspirants before they join the organization through orientation. Everything must be known to them including the expectation from its members and what they would get from joining this group. So before a member commits himself to the aspiration of the organization, he would have known first what is required of him and where the organization will lead him. (3) In cases where members get in the organization without a clear view of the organization's profile, an extensive orientation could be an answer. An orientation is similar to leveling-off with its new members or participants. It is where the objectives of the organization, the mission of each member in relation to the mission-vision of the organization and the organization's approach in meeting its objectives are given. Also, policies are laid down and job description is given. This is similar to meeting eye-to-eye or to reach an understanding from both ends of the committing parties. The orientation is very significant as an employee's base or a member's foundation in the organization. A complete understanding of one's goal and direction shall set the momentum of each member. From there, he would then know what to do and where to go. AND TO SOLIDIFY their stay in the organization, the best teacher would be to make the members experience its aspirations. ""The process of reaching out can be a slow one--you need to build relationships and trust before some folks will even come to a meeting."" In a write-up about involvement, there are 6 Rs of Participation. These Rs represent the benefits people look for when joining a group that will outweigh the cost of joining. Meaning, these are possible reasons or motives why people join groups. All may not be present but a combination of two or more in our activities could help to make people get involved. These are 1) Recognition, 2) Respect, 3) Role, 4) Relationships, 5) Rewards, and 6) Results. We may consider these Rs to assess if it's present in our organization. Recognition. Members wanted to be recognized by their contributions to the organization. Knowing that they are given opportunities to be heard gives them satisfaction that their efforts are being valued by the organization. This gives value to their self worth as well. As Christians, we wanted to be recognized as members of the Church knowing that we indeed follow the teachings of Christ. We attribute our deeds or accomplishments to our Father who works on us all. Thus, our recognition is when we feel that He does work on us. Respect. We know that we are taught to respect all people. But not always do we get respect from our work place or community. As Kapians, we show our respect to our brethren by giving them a hand and welcoming them, whatever social strata they come from. Contrary to what many says KAPI is not an organization of the rich, because majority of its members are earning average income. That's why fish ball vendors and even widows had joined the group. Role. The reason why we entered a company or an organization is because we need to be needed. We want to belong to a group where our unique role and contribution can be appreciated. Thus, it is essential that we share roles across the entire group. KAPI's door is always open for an extra hand or shoulder to carry the load. We invite you, if you are not yet a member to hear how we need YOU to meet our goal. Relationships. A book describes a ""group"" as organized networks of relationship. People join groups for lots of reasons, including making new friends, broadening network or accomplishing something could not be done alone. KAPI acknowledges the value of relationship. That's why there are activities that enhance relationship among its members. And one of KAPI's core values, UNITY, epitomizes this. Rewards. Not everyone wants the same rewards but rewards come in many forms. Usually, it answers the questions ""What's in it for me?"" In KAPI, rewards can come as spiritual benefit or wealth in heaven. The belief that we will reap spiritual rewards is the best thing we can get by joining the group. Results. Results get people to participate in your group or activity. Making visible and easy activities a part of the group's action planning can go a long way to attracting and keeping people. KAPI makes sure that results of our efforts are transparent to its members. Transparency of records is part of its system. The best result that its members can get is learning that the combined effort of KAPI can produce tangible output. And the best output is helping our Presiding Ministers in their journey. People get involved because the objective of the organization is aligned with their personal objectives. To fully realize the purpose of KAPI, its members should immerse with its activities and feel the significance of its accomplishments in relation to the general direction of the Church. The goal of each one of us is to reach holiness to be able to enter the threshold of heaven. And that can be achieved if we ride the journey of KAPI. Let KAPI be our vehicle to reach our destination.

In 1976 when my father went to work in Haiti for what was the ancestor of SNC-Lavalin and at the time, I was only 4 so remaining in Canada wasn't an option. There, my parents did not want me to go to Haitian school so I started kindergarten in an American Baptist school  and had to figure it out and learn english via immersion. To this day, I think things worked out pretty well.At the same time, I also picked up Haitian Creole and even though its a bit rusty, Spanish too. At age 13 I also had a mini-immersion in Algiers and this helped me update my French from Quebec to international standards as well as acquire basic Arabic...I have relocated to Hong Kong, this is where I wish to continue both my career and life. To integrate here, I am now taking Cantonese classes and I am learning in the same (And most efficient) way as I learned English: by not having a choice but to use it. Yes, I am looking for work here but I'm not just sitting idly and waiting for the phone to ring: I've registered my Russian Martial Art teaching business and looking to make Hong Kong the hub of this discipline in Asia.The last thing that all this has been is easy. I believe that in life, nothing worthwhile is and as we say in French: ""L'effort fait les forts"" (Effort makes the strong).That being said, I'm a ""What you see is what you get"" type of person. I also believe that integrity, enthusiasm, hard work, continuous learning and thinking outside the box are fundamental to one's work ethic and career growth. I'm fervent not only about continuously improving the overall quality of my work but also of finding new ways to add value to it. I thrive for new challenges and to me, facing and overcoming difficulty equates to growth.To put it simply: No pain, no gain.Networking is always welcome at janiklitalien(at)SpecialtiesFighting fraud: Account Takeovers, True Name Fraud, Loss prevention, Anti Money Laundering, Customer service, Martial Arts, Computer Upgrading, repairing and servicing in general."
